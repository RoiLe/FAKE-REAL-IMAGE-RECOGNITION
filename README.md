<b><u><h1>Data Science final project - Fake & Real images recognition</h1></u></b>
by Lior Guetta & Roi Levi

In today's world, where technology is always moving forward, we've reached a point where it's hard to tell if a picture is real or made by a computer. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become so good at making images that look like real photos, it's becoming a challenge to tell them apart. This project focuses on figuring out which images are real and which are made by AI.

As more and more images made by AI show up everywhere, we face new problems. Sometimes, these images might be changed or completely made up, and it's really important to find ways to tell if an image is real or not. Our project wants to solve this problem by finding methods that can clearly show if a picture was made by a computer or if it's a real photo.

<b>Here are just a few examples of image generators that we are encountering:</b>

<b><u>Our purposal</u></b>

We're going to look closely at how to analyze images, use collections of both real and AI-made pictures, and apply some smart computing techniques. Our goal is to help people understand more about how trustworthy digital pictures are.

We're starting this project to separate real pictures from those made by AI, and we invite you to join us in this exciting challenge. By working on this, we hope to help make a future where we can look at a digital picture and know if it's real, making our digital world a more trustworthy place.


<b>about the dataset</b>

The dataset we will be utilizing is CIFAKE, which comprises 60,000 synthetically generated images and 60,000 authentic images sourced from CIFAR-10. CIFAR-10 is a widely employed collection of images for training machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It encompasses pictures of airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks, making it one of the most prevalent datasets in machine learning research. The dataset is categorized into two classes: <b>REAL and FAKE</b>.

For the REAL class, the images were collected from Krizhevsky & Hinton's CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) dataset.

Concerning the FAKE images, they were generated using Stable Diffusion version 1.4, a technique primarily employed for generating detailed images conditioned on text descriptions. While its main application is generating images guided by text, Stable Diffusion can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and image-to-image translations based on a text prompt. In this dataset, fake photos are generated by providing Stable Diffusion with real photos from CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion, in turn, generates synthetic photos.
